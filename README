DSP.js is a comprehensive digital signal processing library for javascript. 
It includes many functions for signal analysis and generation, including 
Oscillators(sine, saw, square, triangle), Window functions (Hann, Hamming, etc), 
Envelopes(ADSR), IIR Filters(lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch), FFT and DFT 
transforms, Delays, Reverb.

Modules:

  DFT(bufferSize, sampleRate): Discrete Fourier Transform

    Usage: 

    var dft = new DFT(1024, 44100);
    dft.forward(signal);
    var spectrum = dft.spectrum;


  FFT(bufferSize, sampleRate): Fast Fourier Transform

    Usage:

    var fft = new FFT(2048, 44100);
    fft.forward(signal);
    var spectrum = fft.spectrum;


  Oscillator(waveform, frequency, amplitude, bufferSize, sampleRate): Signal Generator
    * Sine wave
    * Square wave
    * Saw wave
    * Triangle wave

    Usage:

    var osc = new Oscillator(SINEWAVE, 440, 1, 2048, 22050);
    osc.generate();
    var signal = osc.signal;


  ADSR(attack, decay, sustainLevel, sustain, release, sampleRate): Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release Envelope
    
    Usage:

    var envelope = new ADSR(0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 44100);
    envelope.process(signal);


  IIRFilter(filter, cutoff, sampleRate): Infinite Impulse Response Filters
    * Low Pass Filter
    * High Pass Filter

    Usage:

    var filter = IIRFilter(LOWPASS, 200, 44100);
    filter.process(signal);


  MultiDelay(maxDelayInSamplesSize, delayInSamples, masterVolume, delayVolume): Delay which feeds back its own delayed signal	
  
    Usage:

    var delay = MultiDelay(44100*5, 44100*1, 1.0, 0.6);
    delay.process(signal);  
    

  Reverb(maxDelayInSamplesSize, delayInSamples, masterVolume, mixVolume, delayVolume, dampFrequency): Reverb
  
    Usage:

    var reverb = Reverb(20000, 6500, 0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 4500);
    reverb.process(signal);
